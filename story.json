    "Thousands of stars are shining in the sky, and besides starlight, the space around you is nothing but darkness. The surface under your feet seems to be water, but it feels solid. This space of vacuum has no end, as far as you can see, the water surface meets the dark sky in the distance. There is no sound here too. It is so quiet that you can even hear your own heartbeats.",
    "'Well, here I am again.' You say to yourself.",
    "You realize this is a dream. You are sure about this because you have had this dream for so many times. More and more weird things are happening since you come bacck from the Forgotten Land. The climate changes dramatically these days. The number of rabbits increases a lot around the village. And now, you are stuck in the same dream everyday. You had a feeling that something big is going to happen, and tried to explore this strange space in your dream.",
    "However, no matter how far you go, the space arround you stays the same. In the end, you have to accept this endless loneliness. So today you lie down, looking up into the sky as usual. There is nothing in your mind, and you know you need to bear this lonliness until next morning.",
    "But today is different. Strangely, you hear some faint sound. The sound gradually becomes clear: someone is walking on the water. You stand up in astonishment and look in that direction. A silhouette appears in your sight."
